# DDM Bundle - ComfyUI Custom Nodes

Clean workflow routing nodes for ComfyUI. Say goodbye to spaghetti connections!

## Features

- **Set Node**: Store any value with a unique identifier
- **Get Node**: Retrieve stored values anywhere in your workflow
- Works with all data types (images, latents, models, text, etc.)
- No more messy connection lines across your canvas

## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation
1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
```

2. Clone or download this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DDM_Bundle.git
```
   
   Or manually create a folder called `DDM_Bundle` and copy all files into it.

3. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 2: ComfyUI Manager
*Coming soon - install directly through ComfyUI Manager*

## Usage

### Basic Example

1. **Set a Value**
   - Add a "DDM Set Value" node
   - Connect any output to it (image, latent, model, etc.)
   - Give it an ID like `"my_image"`

2. **Get the Value**
   - Add a "DDM Get Value" node anywhere else in your workflow
   - Type the same ID: `"my_image"`
   - The value will be retrieved automatically

### Advanced Features

- **Optional Default**: Get Node has an optional default input if the value isn't found
- **Pass-through**: Set Node outputs the same value it receives, so you can chain them
- **Any Type**: Works with any ComfyUI data type automatically

## Nodes

### DDM Set Value
- **Inputs**:
  - `value`: Any type - the value to store
  - `id`: String - unique identifier for this value
- **Outputs**:
  - `value`: The same value (pass-through)

### DDM Get Value
- **Inputs**:
  - `id`: String - identifier to retrieve
  - `default` (optional): Any type - fallback if ID not found
- **Outputs**:
  - `value`: The retrieved value

## Tips

- Use descriptive IDs like `"prompt_text"`, `"final_image"`, `"lora_model"`
- Set nodes must execute before Get nodes (ComfyUI handles this automatically)
- IDs are case-sensitive
- Use the same ID in Set and Get nodes to connect them

## Troubleshooting

**Get node shows validation error?**
- Make sure there's a Set node with the same ID somewhere in the workflow
- The validation should pass automatically with this version

**Getting None values?**
- Check that the Set node is actually executing (not disabled)
- Verify the ID matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Make sure the Set node runs before the Get node

## Version History

- **v1.0.0** - Initial release
